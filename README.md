Project one for CPSC 223C (Tic-Tac-Toe)


Here we have a Tic-Tac-Toe program written in C using a 2D char array. Instead of filling the array with 1, 2, 3,...,9 we filled it up with empty space to give the table a better
view. That did lead to a more tedious process of checking if the game has been won by a player but it was managable.

Made by Bryan Cortes.
